## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

I'm currently in my **3rd year of B.Tech (CSE)** and working toward a career in game development and software engineering. Riot Games is my dream company, and this repo is part of my long-term plan to apply confidently, with hands-on coding experience to show.

## 🛠 Future Plans

- Add Riot API-based programs
- Build a reaction timer game
- Integrate simple GUI using `tkinter` or `pygame`
